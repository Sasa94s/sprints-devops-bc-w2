| Stakeholder                 | Unaware | Resistant | Neutral | Supportive | Leading |
|-----------------------------|---------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Application User            |         |           |         | C D        |         |
| Product Team                |         |           |         | C          | D       |
| Technical Team              |         |           |         | C          | D       |
| Public Service Providers    |         |           |         | C D        |         |
| Central Bank of Egypt       |         | C         | D       |            |         |
| Financial Service Providers |         |           |         | C D        |         |
| Google Maps                 |         |           |         | C D        |         |
| Application Store           |         | C         | D       |            |         |

**Notes:**
- **Product Team & Technical Team:** are aimed to be moved from Supportive side to Leading side gradually after delivering
the first 4 or 6 sprints; so their engagement with the other stakeholders could be effective accordingly.
- **Central Bank of Egypt:** is aimed to be moved from _Resistant_ side to _Neutral_ side by putting their regulations 
and testing rules as a high priority during planning, to overcome such rejection issues that might delay our go live.
- **Application Store:** is aimed to be moved from _Resistant_ side to _Neutral_ side by following security guidelines and their policies
during each delivery or feature implementation.
